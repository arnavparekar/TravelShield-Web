## TravelShield

## 💡 Introduction:

**Problem Statement**: Global travelers face challenges in managing health risks and planning safe, personalized trips due to a lack of accessible, tailored health information. Governments also struggle to monitor and control disease outbreaks effectively across regions.

**Solution**: TravelShield provides a comprehensive travel health management solution designed to ensure safer journeys for both travelers and airport authorities. Our mobile app empowers users with personalized health scores, dynamic trip recommendations, and real-time health insights tailored to their medical history and destination conditions. However, the true game-changer is our web platform for airport authorities, which offers a real-time dashboard displaying travelers' health statuses, enabling them to make informed decisions on travel eligibility. This ensures smooth airport operations, minimizes health-related disruptions, and enhances passenger safety by proactively identifying potential risks. By integrating AI-driven insights, multilingual support, and seamless cloud-based infrastructure, TravelShield bridges the critical gap between health and travel, making global mobility safer and smarter.
